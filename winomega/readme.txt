Omega is a rare roguelike game, designed to be played on a character-mode
screen. I have compiled this version for Windows because (for whatever reason)
I was unable to get the old DOS version working.

See omegalib\license.txt for more information about the terms of licensing
Omega; I make no further claims beyond what is in there.

To get help on playing Omega type '?' in the game.

INSTALLATION

Just copy the enclosed files somewhere, maintaining the directory structure
as enclosed (omega.exe in the main directory, omegalib\ containing most of the
other files).

Usage:
  omega.exe - Starts a new game.
  omega.exe <filename> - Loads a previously saved game.

NOTES

I've only tested omega.exe on Windows XP, but it should work on anything from
Windows 98 on. As this is v0.2, there may be bugs (not to mention the
occasional bug in the main Omega program). Please drop me an email with any
bugs, or just drop me an email to let me know things are working right.
