Omega for Windows v0.3 (0.90.4)

Announcing the release of Omega for Windows v0.3 (0.90.4), a port of Omega for
Windows.

Omega is a rare roguelike game, designed to be played on a character-mode
screen. I have compiled this version for Windows because (for whatever reason)
I was unable to get the old DOS version working.

Release 0.3 has a full fledged installer, as well as upgrades to the tooling
used to compile. There are no feature or bug updates from 0.2.

Thanks,
Geoff Dunbar (gdunbar@prankster.com)
